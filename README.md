# Unit-20_Hack-or-Snooze

Question #1:    ***** I think we resolved this one******

When I pressed on the Hack-or-Snooze link in the Nav bar, all the stories generate. When I press on the submit link in the nav bar, enter
everything in the submit section, and then press submit, it was originally not adding the story to the top. I needed to set a DOM refresh is why it worked 
when I went back to the Hack-or-snooze link in the nav bar.

Question #2:

I am having trouble with the "my-stories" link in the nav bar. It works if I am signed in and submit a new story. However, it does not work if I sign out and 
then sign back in. It is like it is not posting to the API,  but I thought I had it calling a function to run a Post request.

Question #3:

I am really struggling with making the star as a favorite. We worked on the "id" being unique, but it still is having trouble running the function with success.

Question #4:

When I watched the videos, it seems very easy and clear about setting up Classes, but accessing the classes after they are set up seems to be troublesome for me.
How do I practice this. I think that is holding up some of my code and that may be why I can't get certain parts to work.

Question #5:

I'm just very lost with this. Jeopardy was so much easier. However, they did not give me much starter code in Jeopardy, so maybe its because I have to work
harder to understand how they have everything set up before I can really dive into this code. You said maybe we will use this next week to elaborate how to
tackle future projects.

Question #6:

Really any suggestions on this would be helpful. I am so lost on this project.
